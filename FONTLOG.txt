FONTLOG for Eddie Sans

This file provides detailed information on the Eddie Sans Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Eddie Sans fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Eddie Sans is a work in progress condensed typeface with a bold personality. Inspired by interchangeable letter boards and the charm of mid-century hand-painted signs, Eddie stands out with its large x-height and expressive character. Eddie Sans is currently in beta. The typeface works best in larger text like headers and subheadings, making it well suited for branding and packaging. Eddie Sans is an ongoing project, with future plans to expand its language support and refine its spacing and kerning for optimal usability.
